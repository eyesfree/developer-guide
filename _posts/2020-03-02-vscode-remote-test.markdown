Today I tested the cool solution by Lucas&Lukas. Thank you guys! Here are the steps:


1. Get VSCode remote ssh plugin
2. Create a new instance on the cluster
3. Execute the script with Windows Powershell ( not ISE and not as Administrator )
4. Make sure that the known_hosts file has the right permissions
5. Checkout or create a new repository and enjoy!
