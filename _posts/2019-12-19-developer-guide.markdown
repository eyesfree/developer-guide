As a start here is a list of checks for your current developer habits: 
1. Always using your organisation code formatter
2. Follow the coding rules for your programming language, for example: http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines
3. Writing tests and developing against them - only then you have understood the subject
4. Updating the build script and building locally before comiting
5. Keeping the commit message in your organisation's format
